# Cloth Classifier
The TechLabs project presented by Group 1: **lostInPix Classifier Squad**
### Our project idea in one sentence: 
With one photo we can fully categorize a piece of clothe into several atributtes
### This is our motivation behind it: 
Most of the time when you lose something and want to search in a lost and found, you need to go through most of the times there. We want this process to be smarter. Whenever something goes to lost and found a picture gets taken and out model will classify it into different attributes
### This is what a final result of the project might look like:
You take a picture of a piece of clothe and our model correctly categorize it with different attributes that match what you would like to search for
